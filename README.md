# Hey There! I am Riddhimaan Singh

Linux • Operating Systems • Kernel • Security • CLI Tools  

Student developer focused on **Linux internals**, **operating system development**, and **security tooling**.  
I build low-level projects to understand how systems work beneath the abstraction layers.

## 🧠 Core Skills & Interests
- Linux kernel & init systems
- OS development (initramfs, rootfs, boot process)
- BusyBox-based systems
- Shell scripting & CLI tooling
- Python for systems & security tools
- Cryptography fundamentals
- Hash analysis & brute-force techniques
- Virtualization (QEMU)

## 🔧 Featured Projects

### 🖥️ sth404_OS — Custom Linux Operating System
A **custom Linux OS** built from scratch for learning and experimentation.
- Custom kernel configuration & branding
- BusyBox-based root filesystem and initramfs
- Live ISO with installer
- QEMU-tested and real hardware aware
- Focus on Linux boot process, init, and userspace

**Keywords:** Linux OS, custom Linux, initramfs, BusyBox, kernel, operating system

### 🔐 Cryptographic Wiper (Research Tool)
A Python-based **cryptographic data destruction tool** for analysis and learning.
- Secure overwrite techniques
